GoFAST – Carpooling Web App for FAST NUCES Students 🚗
🚀 Project Overview
GoFAST is a web application built to connect FAST NUCES students for carpooling. The goal is to reduce transportation costs, promote eco-friendly travel, and build a strong campus community. The app ensures safety by only allowing access through verified university email addresses.

📚 Introduction and Background
Carpooling helps save money, reduce traffic, and minimize environmental damage. Apps like InDrive and Yango exist but don’t focus on university students' needs. GoFAST fills this gap by offering a platform that is:

Exclusive to FAST NUCES students

Safe through email verification

User-friendly with features built for students
